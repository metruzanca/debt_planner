## Side Story

This repo was started on a Plane!

And I was mid air when I learned you can't even build a gleam new project without internet :(. So what I did was took my local copy of [Jak's squirrel](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri/squirrel) and made a copy of it to use as my base, since I had made a build before take off, it had all the default stuff needed. Then I just cleaned up what I didn't need and copied over the starting files from my broken gleam new.
